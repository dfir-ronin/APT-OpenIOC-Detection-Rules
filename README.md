This repository contains OpenIOC rules to aid in hunting for indicators of compromise and TTPs focused on Advanced Persistent Threat groups.

These rules can be utilized as hunting or detection rules that can be added to your EDR security solution's user-defined and/or custom intelligence database to enhance its detection capabilities. Environment-specific tuning is recommended before deploying these as detection rules.

Detection engineering is based on the tools, techniques, tactics, and procedures observed from the following references including, but not limited to:
